# Microsoft Word To Google Calendar 

Converting a Microsoft Word document with lines in the form of: "mm/dd/yy : Event Name" into events on your Google Calendar

Ensure the date/name entry pairs are on their own lines and have the appropriate formatting.
The "(space):(space)" is crucial to include between your date and event name. Examples below:

1/1/24 : New Year's Day

1/15/24 : MLK Day

2/2/24 : Groundhog Day

2/14/24 : Valentine's Day

2/19/24 : President's Day

The WordToCalendarDemoDoc has also been added to be used for testing.

# Note

The project is currently in testing mode which means unauthorized users won't be able to connect their Google accounts and thus their calendars.
